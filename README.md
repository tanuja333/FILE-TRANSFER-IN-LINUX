# FILE-TRANSFER-IN-LINUX
File sharing allows a number of people to use the same file or file by some combination of being able to read or view it, write to or modify it, copy it, or print it. File sharing can also mean having an allocated amount of personal file storage in a common file system. To share the information, it is desirable to have a simple method of sharing the information with two personal computer systems. Here we are going to implement a network file-sharing application that makes sending a file to another machine on the local network as easy as draggingand-dropping.
